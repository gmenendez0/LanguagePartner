## Project Setup

This project is a mobile application built with:

* **Client:** React Native using Expo
* **Server:** Node.js with Express

This README will guide you through setting up the development environment for both the client and server.

### Client

To run the React Native client using Expo, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website [Node.js download].

**Running the Client:**

1. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

2. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the required dependencies for the client:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (or yarn install if you're using yarn)

3. **Start the development server:** Run the following command to start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   This will start the Expo development server and open your client in a web browser or on your mobile device using the Expo Go app.
